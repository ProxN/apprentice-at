# Apprenticeships
Apprenticeships are an age-old method for learning a skilled trade â€” be it blacksmithing, tailoring, or carpentry. Apprentices spend time learning alongside masters of their craft, so that one day they too can become masters (while also earning a little money). So why should learning to build the web be any different?
