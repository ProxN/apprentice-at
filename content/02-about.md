## Intensive mission training
We know that the standard education model can’t keep up with the web’s universe—curriculum becomes outdated as the tech we use quickly morphs into something new. Technologies come and go at light speed—far too fast for our education system to keep up. But the industry still needs qualified recruits as it grows toward a brighter future.

Apprenticeships are temporary training programs (usually three months to a year), focused on teaching the process of building quality, intentional code to solve problems. Apprentices work alongside seasoned professionals, learning the tools of the trade in the real world—gaining experience that will benefit them (and the web as a whole) for a lifetime.

## Apprentices learn while in orbit
Apprentices get the benefit of learning from people who have been around the solar system—gaining practical knowledge of an industry where the barrier to entry can sometimes feel high. And they get paid to do it. Forget about shelling out your life savings for some boot camp, or going into debt to attend college.

## Test-flight potential hires
And they’re not just good for the apprentices—companies who hire apprentices benefit too. Imagine getting the opportunity to take a test-flight before you hire, letting you know if recruits are the right fit for the long term. Not only that, you get to train them to work the way your team does, so they’ll be ready to fly come launch day.

## Why we built this site
As apprentices ourselves, we learned firsthand the value of participating in an apprenticeship. Getting immersed in code was the best way to learn a modern approach to building the web. We got to pair with professional developers, had regular reviews, and dove deep into the world of Object Oriented Programming, Test Driven Development, and creating modular frontend code. It was the best way possible to expand on our existing industry experience, and it gave us the tools we needed for a successful career on the web.
