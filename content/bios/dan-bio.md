# Dan Rosenthal

I’m an apprentice at Sparkbox in Dayton, where I’m learning the tools to build a better web. Before that, I wrote frontend code and copy for Uncrate and Devour. Web content and responsive design are my thing. When I’m not being a desk monkey, you can find me in my home town of Cincinnati. There I’m most likely tinkering with my ‘33 Ford Hotrod, keeping my Netflix queue in check, or putting the finishing touches on my latest Lego Star Wars set. I’m passionate about the intersection of content and frontend code and am constantly working to improve my skills in JavaScript and Ruby.
