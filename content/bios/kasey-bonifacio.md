# Kasey Bonifacio

I am passionate about web development and am constantly learning new ways to make the web more awesome. I already have 3 years of frontend design and development under my belt, and for the last 4 months, I have been an apprentice at Sparkbox, learning all things code. Once finished, I plan to be on the path to become a full-stack developer. When I can pry myself away from the computer, I can be found spending time with family, cooking, or being crafty.
