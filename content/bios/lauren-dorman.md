Hi, I’m Lauren. I’m an Apprentice at Sparkbox in Dayton, Ohio. I am a multi-city transplant, most recently transplanted from Chicago, Illinois. I am a designer and frontend developer who is passionate about making the web both beautiful and usable. I pride myself in staying in the loop on current design trends and practices. I am a firm believer that learning is something that you should never stop doing. There is always an opportunity to grow, learn, and share best practices with people around you. When my eyes aren't glued to a screen, I enjoy cycling, discovering new tunes, and traveling.
