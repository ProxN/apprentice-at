## Post Launch Checklist


### Project Management Related

After we launch a site, this is the procedure that we will follow. We
will wait approximately 14 days to allow for last minute changes,
bugs, etc.

* [ ] send thank you note after final payment is received and remind of
    30-day support timeframe
* [ ] Send documentation to client. (Check that code is commented well,
    send plugin list, any live or documented training)
* [ ] Archive live code. (Repository or Basecamp.)

### Marketing

* [ ] Submit to Galleries
* [ ] Add to seesparkbox.com work section
* [ ] Blog about launch
* [ ] Tweet from @hearsparkbox
* [ ] Request client quote/recommendation (if appropriate).

### Gallery Submittal:

1. [ ] We do a “normal submission” on www.awwwards.com because
it is well respected and well screened
http://www.awwwards.com/submit
for around $21

2. [ ] Then we use http://thecssgallerylist.com/ for sheer volume to
submit to 100 other sites (hitting many popular ones) for $20.

3. [ ] Then we hand-submit the site to a few other purposeful (but free)
galleries such as:
mediaqueri.es
http://www.mobileawesomeness.com/
