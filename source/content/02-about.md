## What apprenticeships are
We know that the standard education model just doesn’t work for the web — curriculum becomes outdated as the tech we use quickly morphs into something new. Technologies come and go faster than our education system can keep up. But the industry still needs qualified recruits as it grows towards a brighter future. 

Apprenticeships are temporary training programs, focused on teaching young, passionate web makers so they can meet the needs of a rapidly-expanding industry. Apprentices work alongside seasoned professionals, learning the tools of the trade in the real world, instead of a classroom. Whether they’re learning web development, web design, user experience, or mobile development, they’ll get an experience that will benefit them (and the web as a whole) for a lifetime.

## Why apprenticeships are good
Apprenticeships are a time-tested model for teaching newcomers to an industry the skills they need to thrive and succeed. Apprentices get the benefit of learning from people who have been there and done that—gaining practical knowledge of an industry where the barrier to entry can sometimes feel high. And they get paid to do it. Forget about shelling out your life savings for some bootcamp, or going into debt to attend college.

And they’re not just good for the apprentice—companies who hire apprentices gain tremendous benefits as well. Imagine getting the opportunity to bring someone into your team on a temporary basis, sort of like a test-flight before you hire. Not only that, you also get to train them to work the way your team does, so they’ll be a perfect fit should you decide to keep them on after the apprenticeship.

## Why we built this site
As apprentices ourselves, we learned firsthand the value of participating in an apprenticeship. Getting immersed in code was the best way to learn a modern approach to building the web. We got to pair with professional developers, had regular reviews, and dove deep into the world of Object Oriented Programming, Test Driven Development, and creating modular frontend code. It was the best way possible to expand on our existing industry experience, and it gave us the tools we needed for a successful career on the web.
